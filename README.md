# Subliminal_Event_Tracker
Android studio app design thats mostly completed as a part of a project for CS-360
Subliminal was created as an event tracker that users will login to and store different events such as chores or concerts that could then remind the user at a designated time. The main points I focused on was creating a login screen with a good UI as well as the database layout to look well made and presented well accordingly. The UI was very self explanitory with a login button and an add button to create new events, keeping the ease of use at the forefront for creating the app. I coded the app thinking of features that I would want implemented for an app if I was using it daily. After completing an important part of the code I would test the app in the simulation to validate that it worked well. There is still a lot of changes I would like to implement however for an app created in about 5 weeks I am proud of what I created on my own without having any previous experience with android studio.
